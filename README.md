A list of open source games sorted by genre. The projects are at least in beta stage with a code basis that builds
into an executable demo. The code must be under a license that allows modification and sharing by others. For each entry,
relevant information is collected regarding code repositories, download possibilities and build instructions.

If you'd like to add or modify entries, please use the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/Trilarion/opensourcegames/issues),
or fork this repository and submit a pull request.

### Adding a new entry

All entries are stored as markdown (quite human readable) format. Adding a new entry is as easy as modifying the
[template](games/template.md) and putting a modified version in a games category subdirectory.

Here is a description of the fields in the template. Comments start with "//".

<pre>
# {NAME} // name of the game

_{Description}_ // single description line (typically taken from about page of game)

- Home: {URL} // project main site(s) (most significant first)
- Media: {URL} // links to wikipedia and other significant mentions
- State: {XX} // one of {beta, mature} and optional "inactive since YEAR"
- Play: {URL} // link(s) to online play possibility
- Download: {URL} // link(s) to download binary (or source) releases
- Platform: {XX} // list of supported platforms {Linux, Windows, MacOs, Android, ..}
- Keywords: {XX} // list of tags describing the game
- Code repository: {URL} // code repositories (most significant first)
- Code language: {XX} // programming language(s) used 
- Code license: {XX} // license of the code, use "Custom" with comment if the license is modified for the project
- Code dependencies: {XX} // important third party libraries / frameworks used by the project
- Assets license: {XX} // license(s) of the assets (artwork, ..)

// whatever you want to put here

## Building

- Build system: {XX} // typically one of {CMake, Autoconf, Gradle, ..}
- Build instructions: {XX} // link(s) to build instructions offered by the project

// whatever you want to put here
</pre>

- If there are multiple links, licenses, ... separate them by comma.
- The same link can be assigned to different fields (home could also be the code repository, etc.).
- Put comments in "()" parentheses (do not put commas in comments).
- Remove lines with fields that do not apply to the project or where information is not available otherwise.

## Background

I love open source projects and games and I am currently interested in learning more about building systems.
I see the following benefits of this database and further actions I intend to do.

- General information about open source games
- Possibility of improving build instructions on the projects side (not all projects actually have build instructions)
- Simplifying builds
- Adding infrastructure for automatic testing and deploying where not already present
- Revival of abandoned games that do not build anymore
- Simplifying dependencies
- Increasing the number of supported platforms
- Conversion of old repository formats like CVS to Git
