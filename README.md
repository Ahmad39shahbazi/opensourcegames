# Open Source Games

A collection of open source games sorted by genre. The projects are at least in beta stage with a code basis that builds
into an executable demo. Related infos and tips geared toward building the games are collected here. Emphasis is on
support for Windows, Linux and Android.

Motivation: I want to improve the process of building open source games, maybe even rescuing some lost projects.
I concentrate on the hardware/software platforms that I have access to.

## Background

I love open source projects and games and I currently learn about building systems. I see the following benefits of this database
and further actions I intend to do.

- General information about open source games
- Possibility of improving build instructions on the projects side (not all projects actually have build instructions)
- Simplifying builds
- Adding infrastructure for automatic testing and deploying where not already present
- Revival of abandoned games that do not build anymore
- Simplifying dependencies
- Increasing the number of supported platforms
