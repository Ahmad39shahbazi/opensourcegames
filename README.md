# Open Source Games

A collection of open source games sorted by genre. The project are at least in beta stage with a code basis that builds
into a executable demo. Here related infors and tips geared toward building the games is collected. Emphasis is for
support on Windows, Linux and Android.

Motivation: I want to improve building of open source games, maybe even rescuing lost projects. I concentrate on the
hardware/software platforms that I have access.
