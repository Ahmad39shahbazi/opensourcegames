# Open Source Games

A collection of open source games sorted by genre. The projects are at least in beta stage with a code basis that builds
into an executable demo. Related infos and tips geared toward building the games are collected here. Emphasis is on
support on Windows, Linux and Android.

Motivation: I want to improve the process of building open source games, maybe even rescuing some lost projects.
I concentrate on the hardware/software platforms that I have access to.
